#TellMeAboutMe

## Description
An app that honors the DBC Tradition to tell someone about themselves. Users will be able to share something about you, and send it to you

### Features
- *Tell Me Something About Myself* This feature allows a user to request others to tell them something about themself. other users are notified and taken through the process of sending an affirmation back, either anonymously, or with the senders info.
- *Me-Jar* This feature allows a user to get an affirmation out, as if they have a jar of affirmations to pull from. something another person has sent, to reflect on, and brighten their day.

## Context
### Motivation
After watching these beautiful moments happen at DBC, I wanted to be able to create something that allows it to happen to anyone. Being able to hear things that people know to be true about you, is endearing and empowering. This tradition happens when someone leaves DBC, but I envisioned people being able to experience this moment in times they need it most, like before doing something hard, or when they need their spirits lifted. It can also be a way to share when you feel inspired to, not just when that person needs to hear it.

### Personas
Radha is about to head out for another interview, and shes nervous. they don't want to put their business out there on Social Media, but they could really use some words of encouragement.

Leif is about to update their bio, but they are struggling to find the right words to say. They'd like to get people's thoughts in one place, maybe it'll spark some ideas!

Jenal just had the most wonderful experience working with Sky, and wants to share her affirmation with them.
